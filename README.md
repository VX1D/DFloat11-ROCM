**DFloat11** is a lossless compression framework that reduces the size of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models (e.g. FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, etc.) by approximately **30%** while preserving **bit-for-bit identical outputs** to the original model. It enables efficient GPU inference on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing any accuracy.

## 📰 News
- [09/18/2025] Our research paper is accepted to NeurIPS 2025! Hope to see you at the San Diego Convention Center in December!
- [08/24/2025] Compression code released!
  * Reduce the size of any model by 30% with DFloat11 compression.
  * Get started here: [examples/compress_flux1](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11/tree/master/examples/compress_flux1).
- [07/29/2025] Efficient CPU Offloading Now Supported!
  * Our latest update enables highly memory-efficient inference by keeping only one transformer block in GPU memory at a time. For example, CPU offloading reduces peak GPU memory for inference of **FLUX.1-Krea-dev from 17.5 to 9.8 GB, Qwen3-8B from 12.4 to 2.3 GB, and HiDream-I1-Full from 26.4 to 9.6 GB**.
  * An example of using CPU offloading with FLUX.1-Krea-dev-DF11 can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/DFloat11/FLUX.1-Krea-dev-DF11).
  * To enable CPU offloading, simply set `cpu_offload=True` when calling `DFloat11Model.from_pretrained(...)`.
- [05/23/2025] **Wan2.1** support is now live! [`DFloat11/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers-DF11`](https://huggingface.co/DFloat11/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers-DF11)
  * Text-to-video generation with DFloat11 *Wan2.1 14B* using only 24GB VRAM!
  * Get started here: [examples/wan2.1](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11/tree/master/examples/wan2.1).
- [05/06/2025] **DFloat11 now supports [`FLUX.1-dev`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)**
  * 🖼️ Generate stunning text-to-image results on GPUs with **less than 24GB VRAM** --- no quality lost!
  * 📂 Get started here: [examples/flux.1](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11/tree/master/examples/flux.1).
- [05/05/2025] The `dfloat11` pip package has been upgraded to `v0.2.0`! Run `pip install -U dfloat11[cuda12]` to upgrade to the latest version. We have made the following important changes:
  * We added support for Qwen 3, Gemma 3, and Phi 4!
  * The GPU decompression kernel is now 20-40% faster! We achieved it by improving thread occupancy and implementing tons of optimizations.
  * The DFloat11 models are now stored in safetensors format for better safety and loading performance.
  * When using a DFloat11 model, only the compressed model is downloaded, not the original model.

## 📦 Installation

Requires a CUDA-compatible GPU (with CUDA 12) or AMD GPU (with ROCm 7.2+) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed.

To install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install -U dfloat11[cuda12]
```

[Optional] To compile the GPU kernel and install locally:
```bash
nvcc -O3 -ptx dfloat11/decode.cu -o dfloat11/decode.ptx
pip install .[cuda12]
```

### AMD GPUs (ROCm)

This fork adds ROCm support via HIPRTC (runtime kernel compilation). No pre-compiled binaries needed — the decode kernel compiles at runtime within PyTorch's HIP context.

```bash
pip install -U dfloat11
```

Requires ROCm 7.2+ with the PyTorch ROCm build. See [ROCm.md](ROCm.md) for setup details.

#### ROCm Benchmarks (RX 7800 XT, gfx1101)

NLLB-1.3B, eng→pol translation, beam=4, 99 sentences. **0/99 output diffs** (lossless).

| Batch size | BF16 (ms/sent) | DF11 (ms/sent) | Overhead |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1          | 464            | 602            | +30%     |
| 4          | 174            | 214            | +23%     |
| 8          | 123            | 149            | +21%     |

Peak VRAM: BF16 4473 MB, DF11 3811 MB (**-662 MB / -15%**)

Overhead drops with batch size (decode cost is constant, amortized over more tokens). DF11 uses less VRAM because weights stay compressed.

ROCm-specific optimizations over upstream CUDA kernel:
- LUT preloaded into LDS (shared memory) — 1.52x faster decode vs global memory reads
- Compiled code object cached to disk — no recompilation on subsequent runs
- GPU architecture auto-detected from PyTorch (`gcnArchName`)

## 🔍 How It Works

DFloat11 compresses model weights using **Huffman coding** of BFloat16 exponent bits, combined with **hardware-aware algorithmic designs** that enable efficient on-the-fly decompression directly on the GPU. During inference, the weights remain compressed in GPU memory and are **decompressed just before matrix multiplications**, then **immediately discarded after use** to minimize memory footprint.

Key benefits:

* **No CPU decompression or host-device data transfer**: all operations are handled entirely on the GPU.
* **Decompression overhead is constant** per forward pass and **independent of batch size**, making DFloat11 increasingly efficient at larger batch sizes.
* DFloat11 is **much faster than CPU-offloading approaches**, enabling practical deployment in memory-constrained environments.
* At batch size = 1, inference is approximately 2× slower than the original BF16 model, but the performance gap narrows significantly with larger batches.
* The compression is **fully lossless**, guaranteeing that the model’s outputs are **bit-for-bit identical** to those of the original model.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the `dfloat11` pip package. See [Installation](#-installation).
2. Run the following code in Python, which automatically downloads the DFloat11 `Qwen3-8B` model and generates a response.
  ```python
  import torch
  from dfloat11 import DFloat11Model
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer

  model_id = "DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11"

  model = DFloat11Model.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto")

  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

  prompt = "Question: What is a binary tree and its applications? Answer:"
  inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", padding=True).to(model.device)

  with torch.no_grad():
      output = model.generate(
          **inputs,
          max_new_tokens=256,
          do_sample=True,
      )

  print(tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True))
  ```
3. Replace the `model_id` in the script above with any pre-compressed model in the [Model Hub](#-model-hub).

## 🏎️ Benchmarking Performance

To test the speed and memory consumption a DFloat11 LLM during inference:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference.py \
  --model_name_or_path DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11 \
  --prompt "Question: What is a binary tree and its applications? Answer:" \
  --num_tokens 512 \
  --batch_size 1
```

> 💡 **Tip**: If you specify multiple CUDA devices (e.g., `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1`), the model will be automatically distributed across them using 🤗 Accelerate's `device_map="auto"`.

### Arguments

- `--model_name_or_path`: HuggingFace name or local path of the DFloat11 model (e.g., `DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11`). See the [Model Hub](#-model-hub) section for a list of available DFloat11 models.
- `--bf16`: *(Optional)* Turn on this flag when passing a BFloat16 model to `--model_name_or_path`
- `--prompt`: Input prompt string for text generation
- `--num_tokens`: Number of new tokens to generate per sample
- `--batch_size`: Number of prompts to process in parallel
- `--seed`: *(Optional)* Random seed for reproducible results

### Output

The script prints:
- Generated responses
- Total decoding latency
- Tokens per second (throughput)
- GPU memory usage (allocated and peak)

## 🗜️ Compressing Models (BFloat16 → DFloat11)

The DFloat11 compression utility is exposed via the `compress_model` function.

Check [examples/compress_flux1](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11/tree/master/examples/compress_flux1) for a detailed example on compressing the FLUX.1 model.
